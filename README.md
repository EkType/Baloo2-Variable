# Baloo 2

A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. This heavy spurless design has garnered praise for its distinctive jovial nature and its multi script design.

Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional weights and glyphs, redesign of Baloo Tammudu and Baloo Bahaijan, engineering improvements and is available as a variable font. It has five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the amiable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Balooâ€™s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.

Just like the heavier weight, the lighter generation of Baloos speak many tongues. The project consists of ten font families with unique local names for each of the ten Indic scripts. Each family supports one Indic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.
